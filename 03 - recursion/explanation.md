# Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. In JavaScript, a function can call itself, and it typically requires a base case to stop the recursion and prevent it from running indefinitely.

### A recursive function consists of two main components:

1. **Base case**: This defines the condition under which the function stops calling itself.
2. **Recursive case**: This is the part where the function calls itself with modified arguments.

### How it works:

1. The function keeps calling itself with updated parameters until it reaches the base case.
2. Once the base case is reached, the function stops calling itself, and the results are returned.
